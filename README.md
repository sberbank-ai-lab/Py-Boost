# Py-boost: a research tool for exploring GBDTs

Modern gradient boosting toolkits are very complex and are written in low-level programming languages. As a result,

* It is hard to customize them to suit oneâ€™s needs 
* New ideas and methods are not easy to implement
* It is difficult to understand how they work

Py-boost is a Python-based gradient boosting library which aims at overcoming the aforementioned problems.

## Py-boost Key Features

**Simple**. Py-boost is a simplified gradient boosting library but it supports all main features and hyperparameters available in other implementations.

**Fast with GPU**. Despite the fact that Py-boost is written in Python, it works only on GPU and uses Python GPU libraries such as CuPy and Numba.

**Easy to customize**. Py-boost can be easily customized even if one is not familiar with GPU programming (just replace np with cp).  What can be customized? Almost everuthing via custom callbacks. Examples: Row/Col sampling strategy, Training control, Losses/metrics, Multioutput handling strategy, Anything via custom callbacks


## Installation

pip install -U py_boost


## Quick tour

Py-boost is easy to use since it has similar to scikit-learn interface. For usage example please see:
